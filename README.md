## Viewing the static version

This project also includes a minimal static build that mirrors the React layout.

1. Open `public/static/index.html` directly in your browser to view it.
2. Optionally, run a local server from the project root:

   ```bash
   npm run static
   ```

   Then navigate to the printed URL to preview the static site.
